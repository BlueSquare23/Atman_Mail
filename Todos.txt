## Frontend

## Backend
* Add try, excepts around SMTP/IMAP connection logic.
	- Pipe back to connection settings.
		- Maybe make test connection button.
* Break User and Connection Settings out into two different db tables.
	- See connection settings new feature.
* Apply puddy and sand down rough edges.
	- Ie. Validate all user input and make sure app responds with appropriate
