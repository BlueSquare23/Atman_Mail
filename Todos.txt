## Testing
* Need some form of testing badly. Everything is a mess and one change breaks
  everything. I keep accidentally committing broken code.

## New Feature
* When you refresh after getting a new message it gives a "new message" alert.
* Ability to see richly formatted messages and attachments in view msg window.
* Add ability to have more than one user account. 
* Implement logging for, smtp/imap connections, db interactions, exceptions,
  and errors.
* Implement testing.

## Frontend

## Backend
* General refactor, rename vars, add comments, cleanup.
	- imap_functions.py logic needs re-evaluated / cleaned up.
* Apply puddy and sand down rough edges.
	- Ie. Validate all user input and make sure app responds with appropriate
	  302, 403, 404, and 200 codes.
		- Testing will help with this.

## Incoming

## Outgoing
* Add ability to attach file to a message.
* Add ability to add CC and BCC.
