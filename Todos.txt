## Testing
* Need some form of testing badly. Everything is a mess and one change breaks
  everything. I keep accidentally committing broken code.

## New Feature
* Make barebones settings page. Allow user to set things like:
	- Delete button behavior (Move to trash vs just delete)
	- Number of messages per page.
* When you refresh after getting a new message it gives a new message alert.

## Frontend
* Make "go to msg number" box on total pages bar.

## Backend
* Add try, excepts around SMTP/IMAP connection logic.

## Incomming
* Make imap settings check function.
	- Pipe back to setup route.

## Outgoing
* Add ability to attach file to a message.
* Add ability to add CC and BCC.
